1.   <stdint.h> is a header file declaring various integer types with certain guaranteed widths. 
2.  It makes clear that you intend to use the data a specific way.
3.  A BYTE i defined as having 8 bit, DWORD and LONG having 32bit and WORD is defined with 16 bit.
4.  The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. It must be
 	set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.
5.  bfSize holds the file size of the bitmap file, while biSize is defined as the size of the Bitmapinfoheader structure.
6.  A negative value for biHeight suggests that the vertical orientation of the image is upside-down.
7.  The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of
	bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
8.  fopen will return NULL if it cannot create the outfile to write to. I don't know why that might happen.
9.  As the program is reading in 1 RGB triple at a time. The header comments seem to confirm.
10. The padding would be 3, because 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel * 3 padding = 12, which is a multiple of 4.
11. fseek is used to move a position pointer through a file stream.
12. SEEK_CUR indicates the current position of the position pointer.
